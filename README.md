# Our Take on Monopoly – Waterloo Style!

Welcome to Watopoly, a Monopoly-inspired board game set on the University of Waterloo campus! This project was developed as part of our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course (CS246), where we applied fundamental software design principles to create a fun and engaging game.

Whether you're a student reminiscing about your time at Waterloo, a board game enthusiast, or a developer interested in object-oriented design, we hope you enjoy exploring our project as much as we enjoyed building it!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🛠️ Project Overview
Watopoly follows the core mechanics of Monopoly but with a UW twist. Instead of Boardwalk and Park Place, you’ll find Waterloo landmarks like MC (Mathematics & Computer Building), DC (Davis Centre), and SLC (Student Life Centre). Players can buy, trade, and mortgage buildings, all while navigating student life expenses such as tuition fees and co-op terms.

This game was developed with a focus on clean, maintainable, and modular code, ensuring good separation of concerns and low coupling between components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🎮 How to Play?
Watopoly is a text-based game, running in the terminal. You’ll roll dice, move across the board, buy properties, and try to outlast your opponents financially!

# Basic Commands
Command	Description
roll	Roll the dice and move forward
buy	Purchase the property you landed on
trade	Trade properties or money with another player
mortgage	Mortgage a property to get cash
unmortgage	Unmortgage a property you previously mortgaged
assets	View your owned properties and cash
save <filename>	Save your game progress
load <filename>	Load a previously saved game
(For a full list of commands, refer to the documentation in the project folder.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🖥️ Technical Details
This project was built using C++ with a strong emphasis on object-oriented principles, including:
✔ Encapsulation – Each class manages its own data and logic.
✔ Polymorphism – We use inheritance to differentiate between different types of tiles.
✔ Abstraction – The core game logic is abstracted into manageable modules.
✔ Low Coupling & High Cohesion – Ensuring easy modification and scalability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 📌 Features
✅ Fully functional Monopoly game with all core mechanics.
✅ Waterloo campus-themed properties (instead of city landmarks).
✅ Auction system when a player chooses not to buy a property.
✅ Save and Load feature to continue your game later.
✅ Special tiles like Needles Hall (random events) and Go to Tim’s (like Jail).
✅ Dynamic trading system allowing fair negotiations between players.
✅ Object-oriented architecture for modularity and maintainability.

# 💡 What We Learned
Building a Large-Scale OOP Project
This was a challenging yet rewarding project that reinforced our understanding of object-oriented programming. We had to think critically about class design, dependency management, and scalability to ensure a well-structured codebase.

Collaboration & Version Control
Since this was a team project, we learned how to effectively work with Git. We encountered (and resolved!) several merge conflicts, improving our ability to debug collaboratively. Using branch-based development, we ensured that new features were implemented without disrupting existing functionality.

Time Management & Prioritization
Initially, we planned to implement a bot player but underestimated the time required for debugging. This taught us the importance of realistic scheduling and flexibility in software development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🚀 Future Improvements
Given more time, we would love to expand Watopoly with:
✔ AI Bot Player – A computer-controlled player to compete against.
✔ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – A visual version of the game instead of text-based.
✔ More Waterloo Landmarks – Expanding the board with additional locations.
✔ Multiplayer Online Mode – Allowing friends to play remotely.
